# Releasing MeiGen across channels

A source change is not a publication. Record the source commit, selected version, validation evidence, and result separately for each channel. Never stage, publish, approve, push, or submit an external PR merely because local validation passed.

## Independent release versions

| Channel | Source and version | Release boundary |
|---|---|---|
| npm `meigen` | `package.json`, lockfile, runtime server version | Registry package; MCP configuration pins refer to this version |
| Self-owned Claude marketplace | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry and `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Keep these two versions equal; they may differ from npm |
| ClawHub standalone Skill `creative-toolkit` | `openclaw/SKILL.md` and `openclaw/references/` | Independent Skill version; this change prepares **1.0.39**; re-read the registry latest before publication and increment it if necessary |
| ClawHub plugin `meigen-ai-design` | `plugin/openclaw.plugin.json` and `plugin/` | Independent plugin version; static MCP pin follows npm |
| `wshobson/agents` | Upstream's `plugins/meigen-ai-design` and marketplace entry | Separate reviewed PR; verify that upstream checkout's packaging and version |
| `meigen-docs` | English and Chinese public documentation | Separate deployment and link/API contract checks |
| Aggregator listings | Each site's listing | Separate submission/update; do not infer completion from GitHub or npm |
| Web/remote MCP | Web deployment | Separate API deployment; refresh the host's remote tool list afterward |

npm is prepared at **2.0.2** for the capability/preview compatibility update. Static npm pins follow that version. Distribution manifests keep their independent release versions; this review does not claim their publication. Before an authorized release, verify the destination's versions and record acceptance separately.

## Validate before requesting a release

Use pnpm and the project's configured Node version. Do not change `engines` as a publishing workaround.

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
node scripts/ci/check-frontmatter.mjs
bash scripts/ci/check-versions.sh
bash scripts/ci/check-pinned-npm.sh
pnpm release:dry-run
```

CI first validates package.json against package-lock.json with `npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts`, then imports the existing npm lockfile with `pnpm import` and installs using the resulting frozen pnpm lock. A failed locked install is a failure, not permission to fall back to an unlocked install.

`dry-run` runs package packing without registry writes or loading `.env.local`; it bypasses pnpm's clean-tree requirement only for the dry run. `prepack` rebuilds `dist`. Review the file listing: the package allowlist is `bin`, `dist`, `data`, `SKILLS_API.md`, `COMPOSABLE_WORKFLOWS.md`, `COMPOSABLE_WORKFLOWS.zh-CN.md`, and `MCP_AUTH_AND_RESULTS.md`, plus standard package metadata/docs. Secrets, private npm config, tests, and unrelated worktree files must stay out. A local dry run does not prove registry authentication, available version, or publishing rights.

For a release involving both repositories, explicitly run this additional check with the actual Web checkout path:

```sh
node scripts/ci/check-guidance-sync.mjs /path/to/meigen-web --published
```

It compares npm `src/lib/skill-guidance.ts` with Web `src/lib/skills/mcp-guidance.ts` and checks the Web npm pin. It is intentionally not a default CI requirement: an independent npm clone does not need a sibling Web checkout. Both repositories still need their own tests and deployment review.

## No-key host smoke checks

Use temporary Claude/OpenClaw state directories and no credentials; do not modify the operator's installed plugins. Read CLI help for the installed version before selecting state-directory options. Do not log in or start paid generations.

- Claude: `claude plugin validate ./plugin`, then inspect `claude --plugin-dir ./plugin plugin details meigen`. Also install the local marketplace into the isolated state and inspect it. The local CLI **2.1.241** passed both validations on 2026-09-14. Expect one bundled MCP server, named `meigen`; do not add a duplicate manually.
- OpenClaw: install the local `./plugin` in isolated state and inspect the installed plugin. The manifest explicitly declares skills and the pinned stdio MCP server for native-capable discovery. Check the actual installed ID/format: the public npm CLI **2026.9.4** tested on 2026-09-14 installs this mixed-layout directory as Claude bundle **`meigen`**, with one stdio MCP server, despite current documentation describing native-marker precedence. The ClawHub package name `meigen-ai-design` is a separate distribution identity, not proof of that runtime ID. In Claude-bundle compatibility, commands/agents/output styles are mapped as skill content, and Claude hooks are detected but not executed. Do not promise equivalent Claude runtime behavior.
- Standalone ClawHub Skill: inspect the selected remote version before updating. It supplies guidance; mcporter/MCP connection setup is separate. Verify the pinned npm package exists before telling users to install it.
- npm: verify the packed artifact's tool inventory and no-key public discovery; test auth rejection without sending a real secret. Expect 17 local tools and 14 remote tools after the matching API deployment. Local additions are `enhance_prompt`, `manage_preferences`, and `comfyui_workflow`.

Report install/manifest inspection separately from successfully connected MCP tools and real generation. A host's unavailable or outdated CLI is a verification boundary, not evidence that an advertised channel works.

## Credentials and staged npm publishing

Keep `NPM_TOKEN` in this repository's ignored `.env.local` or private process environment. It must be an npm credential, not a `meigen_sk_` key. Never paste it into chat, check it into Git, ship it in the package, or configure it in the Web application. `.npmrc.release` contains the literal `${NPM_TOKEN}` reference; credentialed helper modes explicitly select that file. `check` loads private credentials and runs read-only `npm whoami`; it verifies identity, not every permission.

```sh
pnpm release:check
```

After explicit authorization to upload a staged package, use the stage-only mode:

```sh
node scripts/release.mjs stage
```

It runs `npm stage publish`, requires a clean Git tree and a CLI that supports staging, and never falls back to direct publishing. Staging writes a package to the registry and reserves that version; it is not a dry run. Record the returned stage ID. A maintainer can inspect the staged artifact and, only with separate publication approval, approve it using npm's normal 2FA flow. See [npm staged publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-stage/). The helper never auto-approves a stage or weakens account settings.

`pnpm release:publish` remains an explicit direct-publication mode for an authorized workflow; it retains Git checks. Do not use it as a fallback when staging/authentication fails. Check the registry version and installed artifact after any authorized publication.

## Deployment and distribution order

Deploy the reviewed Web APIs first: the durable ordinary-generation request contract on `POST /api/generate/v2`, authenticated `GET /api/generate/v2/requests/{requestId}`, structured remote MCP tools, and the five Skill APIs including `upscale_image`. Verify exact-ID replay, transient in-progress 503 (including npm 1.4.0 key retention), changed-input 409, request lookup after key rotation, 402 recovery, the reference video/audio arrays and the remote catalog before distributing npm 2.0.2. Explicit local requestId calls (including wait=false) and requestId recovery depend on this endpoint. Deploying npm ahead of the matching backend blocks those calls with endpoint_unavailable / check_backend; an HTML or unrecognized JSON 404 never permits automatic submission. Known generationId status still uses the existing status endpoint. This release depends on the generation worker admission migration kept in the Web repo (`scripts/release/generation-worker-admission.sql`: the `generations.processing_claim_token` column plus the `claim_generation_worker` / `fail_generation_admission` RPCs; applied to production on 2026-09-17). Apply it to any other environment before deploying that environment's Web backend — the new `/process` refuses to run without it. It does not re-enable a global generation quota.

A backend rollback must retain the compatible request-recovery and durable POST contracts. If a route becomes unavailable, restore it and verify existing IDs before resuming affected workflows. Preserve caller IDs and local receipts; do not treat a missing route as a missing job or ask every user to withdraw an already installed npm package. Include HTML/unknown-JSON 404 (zero paid POST), structured request_not_found, bounded observation retries/cancellation, and completed media-mismatch results in release smoke checks.

Then, after authorization for each channel, release npm, update the self-owned Claude marketplace and chosen ClawHub artifacts, submit the separate wshobson PR, deploy bilingual `meigen-docs`, and update requested aggregators. Pins can be prepared before publication, but users must not be told an unpublished version is installable. Verify live availability at each step and record remaining channels instead of reporting one overall "published" status.

Standalone API image preparation requires a positive purchased-credit balance (upload itself does not charge). Upscale run additionally checks the selected live model, accepted initial price and full eligible balance before preprocessing, then rechecks price before dispatch. Session crisp retains daily credits; API calls use purchased credits only. All-channel Upscale preprocessing uses the existing 1,000-per-day ceiling and a per-instance two-operation memory guard. These are not a distributed byte budget or a charge for uploads. Both MCP Upscale schemas require `confirmedCredits` on the first call as well as retries; refresh cached tool schemas. Ship the matching App resize-confirmation UI: older App versions encountering oversized originals are told to update or confirm through the Web, without silently accepting resizing. Unlimited remains disabled; its legacy RPC bypass is tracked separately and is not part of this release.

The 2.0.2 release allowlist also includes `MCP_AUTH_AND_RESULTS.md`. CI uses Node 24 (the project runtime). Keep Web installation guidance on 2.0.1 until 2.0.2 is verified on npm; update content.ts, McpLanding.tsx, page.tsx softwareVersion and mcp-guidance.ts together in the public-doc release.
