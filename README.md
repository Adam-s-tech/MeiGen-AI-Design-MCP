> **New in 2.0.1:** `generate_video` accepts multiple reference videos and reference audio (`referenceVideos` / `referenceAudios`; local `.mp4/.mov/.wav/.mp3` files are uploaded automatically). Per-model limits come from `list_models`.
>
> **New in 2.0.0:** five guided ecommerce/image Skills, original-image enhancement, upload validation, request recovery and Codex setup. [Use a Skill](#skills) · [Upgrade guide](#upgrading) · [HTTP API](SKILLS_API.md)

## What Is This?

An MCP server that helps your AI assistant create images, videos and ecommerce assets. Connect to the **remote server (14 tools)** or install the **local npm server (17 tools)**. Works in **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, **Windsurf**, **Roo Code**, **OpenClaw**, **Hermes Agent**, and other compatible MCP hosts.

Version **2.0.0** adds five guided Skills: **background removal, Product Detail Images, Marketing Poster, AI Backgrounds and Upscale**. These run on MeiGen Cloud and require a MeiGen API key and purchased credits. The local server also supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and ComfyUI for general image generation; those providers do not run the five Skills.

- Local general image generation supports three backends: **MeiGen Cloud**, **OpenAI-compatible APIs**, or **local ComfyUI**. Use `list_models` for current capabilities.
- Built-in 1,446 curated prompt templates from [nanobanana-trending-prompts](https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts) plus style-aware prompt enhancement
- Callable image/video steps for upstream workflows, optional creative helpers, and a standalone CLI for shell scripts and CI

## Quick Start

<a id="install-with-ai"></a>

### Ask your AI assistant to install

Copy this entire block into **Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another AI assistant that can configure MCP servers**. It can set up the connection and guide you through credentials. ChatGPT web uses the [separate setup below](#chatgpt-web).

```text
Install MeiGen MCP for this AI client using this guide:
https://github.com/jau123/MeiGen-AI-Design-MCP#quick-start

Detect the current client and inspect its MCP configuration without printing
credentials. Preserve other servers and reuse an existing MeiGen entry.
Prefer Streamable HTTP at https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp. For Codex, use
codex mcp add meigen --url https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp
Add bearer_token_env_var = "MEIGEN_API_TOKEN" only after that local
environment variable is configured; otherwise leave authentication unset.
If I need automatic local-file preparation, ComfyUI, or local-only tools, use
the stdio command npx -y meigen@2.0.2 instead. Check that this exact npm
version exists before configuring it; report an unavailable version.
Guide me to enter my MeiGen key in local credentials settings or the launch
environment, never in this chat. Public lookups can be tested without a key.
Reload/reconnect, inspect the actual tool list, and call list_skills to verify.
If you cannot configure or reconnect this client, give me the exact manual
steps and say what remains unverified. If list_skills is missing, report it.
Do not upload images, generate anything, or spend credits during installation.
```

For manual setup, jump to [Codex / ChatGPT desktop](#codex), [ChatGPT web](#chatgpt-web), or the client-specific instructions below.

### 1. Prepare your account

You can browse inspiration and inspect models or Skill prices without a key. To generate with MeiGen:

1. Open [API Keys](https://www.meigen.ai/profile/api-keys) in a desktop browser, sign in, and create a key. The key starts with `meigen_sk_`; the mobile site currently redirects this page.
2. Open your [profile](https://www.meigen.ai/profile) and select **Top Up** to add **purchased credits** to the same account; on mobile use [Premium](https://www.meigen.ai/m/premium). API generation does not use daily free credits; the five Skills have no free attempts, including the first cutout. Use `list_skills` for current Skill prices.
3. Add the key to your MCP host's connection settings. Keep it out of chat messages and shared config files.

### 2. Choose one connection

| | Remote MCP — recommended | Local npm MCP 2.0.2 |
|---|---|---|
| Connection | Streamable HTTP at `https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp` | Node.js process over stdio |
| Tools | 14: MeiGen generation, gallery and the five Skills | The same 14, plus prompt enhancement, preferences and ComfyUI management |
| Reference images | Public image link, an existing MeiGen URL, or actual attachment bytes readable by the host | Local files and public image links are prepared automatically |
| Local extras | Result URLs; the host handles preview/download | General generation saves files; also CLI, offline prompt library and local ComfyUI |
| Plugin extras | A bare MCP connection does not install commands, agents, output styles or hooks | The Claude Code plugin adds these; a bare npm connection also does not include them |
| Updates | Backend changes arrive after server deployment; refresh/reconnect if the host caches tools | Local tool changes require an npm release and a client update |

Choose one server entry for this host to avoid duplicate tools. The two entries use the same MeiGen account and purchased credits.

Install for your client: [Remote settings](#remote-mcp) · [Codex](#codex) · [Claude Code](#claude-code) · [Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf / Roo](#other-clients) · [OpenClaw](#openclaw) · [ChatGPT web](#chatgpt-web).

<a id="skills"></a>

### 3. Try your first Skill

After connecting, ask: **“List the available Skills and their current prices.”** This does not generate an image or spend generation credits. Then provide the required material and describe the result you want:

| Skill / tool | Example request | Required | Optional | Output and cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Background removal — `remove_background` | “Remove this background and give me a transparent PNG.” | One source image | No creative brief needed | One cutout; charged from the first request |
| Product Detail Images — `generate_product_detail_images` | “Use this product photo to make a main shot, a detail close-up and a lifestyle image.” | One product image; resolve the desired count/modules | Product name, selling points, copy, logo, model photo, up to two extra product photos, language and marketplace | 1–6 images; one paid image per module |
| Marketing Poster — `generate_marketing_poster` | “Make one poster for a weekend coffee tasting.” | A brand, event, campaign or topic | Display copy, logo, up to three product images, one style reference, language and style | One poster; images are optional |
| AI Backgrounds — `generate_ai_background` | “Put this product on a sunlit stone counter.” | One product image; desired setting for custom mode | White/smart/custom mode, ratio and quality | One product image with a new background; not a transparent cutout |
| Upscale — `upscale_image` | “Make this original product photo clearer while keeping its appearance.” | One original still PNG/JPEG/WebP image | crisp preserves structure (default); creative reconstructs details and requires acceptance of changes | One enhanced image; video enhancement is not exposed |

The assistant chooses the tool, prepares images, checks status and presents preview/download links. You do not need to write prompts, UUIDs or API parameters. It asks only for missing essential information. An explicit request for a specified count, modules or quality already confirms that scope.

**Product-detail batches:** choose 1–6 modules in total. The presets are main shot (`hero`), close-up (`detail`), lifestyle (`scene`), texture/craft (`material`), how-to-use (`usage`) and brand story (`brand`); custom modules are also supported. MCP requires the assistant to pass modules explicitly, preventing extra images when an argument is omitted. You can specify only the count and let the assistant choose modules. Direct HTTP API calls still default to three images (hero, detail and scene) when modules are omitted. The assistant should calculate the batch cost from the live per-image price and requested count before submitting an unresolved batch.

**Copy and quality:** ask to preserve your wording when exact copy matters; otherwise the service can draft copy from your brief. State the desired text language. Product details and posters default to Fast; Pro costs more. AI Backgrounds defaults to smart/Fast; white mode uses a fixed output specification and ignores ratio/quality options. Current options and prices come from `list_skills`.

**Poster fields:** with `autoCopy: true`, `content` is a brief; with `autoCopy: false`, it is the visible wording to preserve (the selected language may translate it). Put style/layout/design directions in `extraNotes` or `customStyle`, not in verbatim `content`. `extraNotes` may also contain verified facts or explicitly requested display copy; design instructions in it are directions, not text to print verbatim. Use a catalog preset ID for `styleId`, not its display label. Omit both written style fields for Auto; nonempty `customStyle` overrides `styleId`. `styleImage` is the primary visual reference, with written style only as a compatible supplement; do not copy its products, wording or layout. Logo and product references preserve identity.

**Output and timing:** current Product Detail and Poster Fast/Pro tiers both use the 2K preset; quality is not resolution. Actual pixels depend on ratio and provider output. Use current `list_skills` specifications/prices and do not send an unsupported `resolution` argument. Queueing, planning, provider execution and image count affect completion time; no fixed number of seconds is guaranteed. Polling intervals and HTTP timeouts are not ETAs.

**Valid MCP call example:** this illustrative request already supplies the event copy and time. Only `content` below is the exact visible wording; `extraNotes` describes layout and preservation requirements, not additional text to print. Pass it to `client.callTool(...)`. Use `list_skills({skill: "brand-poster"})` for live options and price when choosing. It creates one paid poster without image material. The caller generates and saves a UUID for each real attempt, reuses it for recovery and does not blindly rerun this example.

```json
{
  "name": "generate_marketing_poster",
  "arguments": {
    "requestId": "8f729f7e-934e-4e2c-bae3-bf23a782f964",
    "brand": "Coffee tasting",
    "content": "Coffee tasting\nSaturday, 10:00–12:00",
    "autoCopy": false,
    "extraNotes": "Keep the supplied time. Use a clear headline and a small schedule block.",
    "styleId": "minimalist",
    "language": "en",
    "ratio": "4:5",
    "quality": "low"
  }
}
```

**Images:** for the local npm server, provide an actual file path or a public direct HTTPS image link. For remote MCP, the assistant uses `upload_skill_image` for external links or readable attachment bytes, then passes its `imageUrl` to the Skill. Existing `images.meigen.ai`, `images.meigen.art` or `pbs.twimg.com` HTTPS URLs can be used directly. `upload_skill_image` and `/api/skills/upload` require a positive purchased-credit balance for both local and remote MCP connections. Uploading does not start generation or spend generation credits. If your host cannot read an attachment, provide a direct image URL or use the local npm server.

Local preprocessing accepts source files up to 32 MiB and prepares references up to 4096px / 8 MiB, preserving PNG/WebP transparency. Remote uploads accept a public direct HTTPS image up to 8 MiB, or real base64 bytes up to 3 MiB decoded. Private-network URLs, redirects, authenticated links and IPv6-only sources are unsupported. These are **reference image limits**, not generated output specifications.

**Upscale uses the original:** pass an original local file or public direct HTTPS URL to `upscale_image`; do not resize it with a generic reference uploader. For readable attachment bytes, use `upload_skill_image` with `purpose: "upscale"`. Originals may be up to 64 MiB / 64 million pixels; base64 remains limited to 3 MiB decoded. Only still JPEG/PNG/WebP is supported. Local uploads fully decode, auto-orient, remove metadata and preserve alpha and dimensions; encoding must fit below 9,500,000 bytes. If it cannot, provide a public original URL.

A source larger than 4096px on either edge or 16 million pixels returns `upscale_resize_required` before generation or charging. Explain that resizing can produce a result smaller than the original with limited clarity gain; after acceptance, use `allowDownscale: true` and a new `requestId`. Both MCP transports require `confirmedCredits` on the first call too: use the live `list_skills` quote within the accepted user or upstream workflow budget. This is a pre-dispatch check, not an atomic spending cap. For `price_changed`, obtain acceptance of the updated quote before submitting a new ID with the accepted `confirmedCredits`. Explain possible detail changes before choosing creative mode.

**Direct HTTP API:** developers without an MCP host can use the [complete five-Skill API guide](SKILLS_API.md), including upload, run and recovery examples. `GET /api/skills` supplies capabilities and current prices.

<a id="remote-mcp"></a>

### Remote MCP Endpoint (zero-install, recommended)

In your host's MCP settings, select **Streamable HTTP**, enter `https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp`, and add the HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MEIGEN_API_KEY`. The exact settings screen varies by host. Claude Code also supports:

```bash
# MEIGEN_API_TOKEN must already be set in this terminal's environment.
claude mcp add --transport http meigen https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MEIGEN_API_TOKEN"
```

The remote endpoint supports [stateless Streamable HTTP](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28/), including the 2026-07-28 protocol and compatible 2025 clients. **Stateless means no persistent MCP session is required.** Accepted generation jobs and their billing records still live on the server, so an interrupted conversation can recover them.

There is no npm install or local server process. Changes to remote tools require a **backend deployment**, not an npm release; the client may need to reload its tool list. Remote generation still requires an internet connection. Local npm updates remain necessary when local tools or file-handling behavior change.

<a id="codex"></a>

### Codex / ChatGPT desktop (local Codex host)

Use this setup for **Codex CLI, the Codex IDE extension, and the desktop app when using a local Codex host**. These clients share MCP configuration on the same host. ChatGPT web has a [different connection flow](#chatgpt-web). See the [official Codex MCP guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp).

**Remote — recommended for MeiGen Cloud and Skills:**

```bash
codex mcp add meigen --url https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp \
  --bearer-token-env-var MEIGEN_API_TOKEN
```

The equivalent configuration below also sets timeouts suitable for Skills. Merge it into `~/.codex/config.toml`; if you used the command above, edit its existing `meigen` table instead of adding another one. Preserve your other servers.

```toml
[mcp_servers.meigen]
url = "https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "MEIGEN_API_TOKEN"
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 240
```

**To try public lookups before configuring a key**, omit `--bearer-token-env-var` from the command and `bearer_token_env_var` from the TOML. Add them after setting the variable.

Set `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN` locally in the environment that **launches Codex** before using authenticated tools. This is your MeiGen key, not an OpenAI API key. Codex does not automatically load a project's `.env.local`. If a desktop launch does not inherit your terminal variables, enter the `Authorization: Bearer …` header through its private MCP connection settings when available, or configure `http_headers.Authorization` yourself in your private user-level config. When using a direct Authorization header, remove `bearer_token_env_var` so the connection does not depend on that missing environment variable. Keep the key out of chat and shared project files.

**Local — for automatic local-file preparation, ComfyUI and local-only tools:** use this entry **instead of** the remote entry. Node.js 22 or newer is recommended.

```toml
[mcp_servers.meigen]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "meigen@2.0.2"]
env_vars = ["MEIGEN_API_TOKEN"]
startup_timeout_sec = 90
tool_timeout_sec = 240
```

This forwards your locally configured `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN` to the npm process. To register just the local command with the CLI, use `codex mcp add meigen -- npx -y meigen@2.0.2`, then add the environment forwarding and timeout settings shown above. `meigen init codex` is not supported; use Codex's own MCP configuration.

Restart/reconnect after setup. In Codex CLI, `codex mcp list` checks registration and `/mcp` shows connection status. Then ask **“List MeiGen's available Skills and current prices”** to verify an actual tool call without generating or spending credits. A saved configuration alone does not prove that the server connected. Longer video jobs may need a longer tool timeout.

<a id="chatgpt-web"></a>

### ChatGPT web (public lookups only)

For accounts and workspaces with custom MCP access, enable **Developer mode**, create a custom remote app/plugin, enter `https://www.meigen.ai/api/mcp`, and choose **No Authentication**. After connecting, select it in a conversation and request a public model, Skill-price or gallery lookup. Follow OpenAI's [Developer mode setup](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/developer-mode#how-to-use) for the current settings and availability. A chat message alone cannot install a local npm server into ChatGPT web.

**Paid MeiGen tools are not supported through this ChatGPT web connection yet.** OpenAI's hosted MCP client [cannot send custom API keys](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth#client-identification), while MeiGen currently requires a Bearer API key for generation, image upload and `check_skill` recovery (`check_generation` by known generationId remains public; requestId recovery requires a key). Full support needs a MeiGen OAuth integration. Use Codex or another client that supports Bearer headers for those tools; do not put the key in chat or in the server URL.

### Local npm MCP (Node.js)

Node.js 22 or newer is recommended. The examples below pin **meigen@2.0.2**. After changing an installed version or connection settings, restart or reconnect the host. The five Skills still call MeiGen Cloud and need the account setup above.

<a id="claude-code"></a>

### Claude Code Plugin (npm, local tools)

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add jau123/MeiGen-AI-Design-MCP

# Install
/plugin install meigen@meigen-marketplace
```

**Restart Claude Code** after installation (close and reopen, or open a new terminal tab).

**Alternative marketplace** — also available via [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) (30k+ stars):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin install meigen-ai-design@claude-code-workflows
```

> This marketplace doesn't bundle MCP server config. After installing, add to your project's `.mcp.json`:
> ```json
> { "mcpServers": { "meigen": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "meigen@2.0.2"] } } }
> ```

#### First-Time Setup

Free features work immediately after restart — try:

> "Search for some creative inspiration"

The Claude Code plugin includes a setup command:

```
/meigen:setup
```

For the five Skills, choose **MeiGen Cloud** and configure your MeiGen key in the connection settings. For general image generation, the wizard also offers ComfyUI and OpenAI-compatible APIs. Restart Claude Code after changing configuration. Do not paste secrets into a conversation.

<a id="other-clients"></a>

### Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf / Roo Code

One command to set up MeiGen for any supported AI coding tool:

```bash
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 init cursor      # Cursor
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 init vscode      # VS Code / GitHub Copilot
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 init windsurf    # Windsurf
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 init roo         # Roo Code
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 init claude      # Claude Code (project-level)
```

This writes the correct MCP config file with the right format and path for your tool. If a config file already exists, MeiGen is merged in without overwriting your other servers.

`init` writes a configuration that follows the default npm release tag; the manual examples above pin 2.0.2. To pin an initialized connection too, change its `args` to `["-y", "meigen@2.0.2"]` and restart the host.

<a id="openclaw"></a>

### OpenClaw

Install the full plugin from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/plugins/meigen-ai-design) (includes Skills and an explicit MCP connection; other features depend on the loader):

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:meigen-ai-design
```

Or install only the skill (no commands/agents):

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install creative-toolkit
```

### Use as CLI (no MCP host required)

For shell scripts, CI pipelines, or anyone who wants AI image generation without an MCP host, MeiGen ships a one-shot `gen` command in the same npm package.

```bash
# Set your token locally (create it at https://www.meigen.ai/profile/api-keys on desktop)
export MEIGEN_API_TOKEN=meigen_sk_...

# Generate
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen --prompt "a calico cat in a sunlit kitchen"

# With a specific model + aspect ratio
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen -p "tech logo" -m midjourney-v8.1 -r 1:1

# With a reference image (local file auto-uploaded)
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen -p "product hero shot" --ref ~/Desktop/bottle.jpg

# Submit only — print generationId without polling (good for CI)
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen -p "..." --no-wait

# Machine-readable output (good for jq pipes)
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen -p "..." --json | jq -r '.imageUrls[0]'
```

CLI image output is saved to `~/Pictures/meigen/` (override with `MEIGEN_OUTPUT_DIR`). The five Skills return result links; your host can preview or download them.

`meigen gen --help` lists all flags.

### Other MCP-Compatible Hosts

Add to your MCP config (e.g. `.mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meigen": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "meigen@2.0.2"],
      "env": {
        "MEIGEN_API_TOKEN": "meigen_sk_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Free features (inspiration search, prompt enhancement, model listing) work without any API key.

### Hermes Agent (NousResearch)

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is a first-class MCP client — add MeiGen to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  meigen:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "meigen@2.0.2"]
    env:
      MEIGEN_API_TOKEN: "meigen_sk_..."
    timeout: 2700         # generate_video polls until the server reports a terminal state (long videos can run 15+ min) — default 120s is not enough
    connect_timeout: 120  # first npx download can take a minute
```

> The `timeout: 2700` and `connect_timeout: 120` overrides are important — Hermes defaults (120s / 60s) are tuned for short-running tools and will time out on video generation or first-run npx downloads.

---

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

### Compose with an existing workflow

An upstream Skill can write N scripts, call MeiGen for each first frame, then pass completed frame URLs to `generate_video(firstFrame=...)`. Reference clips (`referenceVideos`, `referenceAudios`) can be mixed in the same call and addressed from the prompt as "Video 1" / "Audio 1". It owns prompts, models/providers, ratios, approved count/budget and presentation. Creative planning and plugin agents are optional; resolved requests do not need repeated approval at every step.

For MeiGen jobs, persist one UUID `requestId` and exact inputs per logical step. Use `wait: false` for an immediate task handle; local npm also accepts `download: false`. Existing local defaults remain `wait: true`, `download: true`; asynchronous calls skip download. Remote MCP returns URLs and has no download setting. Recover with `check_generation` using the original `requestId` or `generationId`. Request lookup requires a MeiGen key belonging to the same account; known generation-ID status remains public remotely. Read `structuredContent` for status, handles, URLs, errors and polling advice.

Local npm bounds concurrent API **submissions** at four, with polling/downloads outside those slots; ComfyUI executes one job at a time. The caller also bounds outstanding work and reserves in-flight costs within its approved budget. Actual backend rate limits and `Retry-After` remain authoritative. Parallel videos are allowed within authorized scope; no ten-image total or atomic batch spending guarantee applies.

Local waiting retries temporary status-query failures within its observation budget; cancellation stops waiting while IDs remain recoverable. A completed media mismatch keeps the actual result and returns `requestedMediaType` plus `review_media_type`. A missing or unrecognized recovery route returns `endpoint_unavailable` / `check_backend`, never permission to submit again. Deploy the matching backend first and preserve recovery APIs during rollback.

See [persistent step IDs, frame/video calls and recovery rules](COMPOSABLE_WORKFLOWS.md).

### MCP Tools

Both entries expose the following 14 cloud tools. The local npm entry adds three local tools, for **17 total**. Read-only lookups do not spend generation credits; `check_skill` still requires the key that owns the request.

| Tool | Entry | Billing / purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `search_gallery` | Both | No generation charge; search inspiration with image previews, at most 3 per call. With a MeiGen key configured the call is authenticated and counts against that account's daily search quota instead of the shared per-IP budget. Local npm also bundles 1,446 prompts. |
| `get_inspiration` | Both | No generation charge; full prompt, images and metadata for a gallery entry. |
| `list_models` | Both | No generation charge; current supported models and options. |
| `generate_image` | Both | Generate an image. Remote uses MeiGen purchased credits; local also supports configured BYOK/ComfyUI providers. |
| `generate_video` | Both | MeiGen key and purchased credits; use the current model options from `list_models`. Reference clips go in `referenceVideos` / `referenceAudios` (`images.meigen.ai` URLs — normally a clip MeiGen generated earlier — or, on the local npm server only, local `.mp4`/`.mov`/`.wav`/`.mp3` files that are uploaded for you; remote MCP takes `images.meigen.ai` URLs only, and other hosts are rejected); per-model clip counts and second budgets come from `list_models`, and reference audio is never billed. |
| `check_generation` | Both | No generation charge; recover by generationId or authenticated requestId. |
| `list_skills` | Both | No key or generation charge; current Skill inputs, defaults and prices. |
| `upload_skill_image` | Both | MeiGen key; prepares a reference without spending generation credits. |
| `remove_background` | Both | MeiGen purchased credits; one transparent cutout. |
| `generate_product_detail_images` | Both | MeiGen purchased credits; 1–6 images, billed per module. |
| `generate_marketing_poster` | Both | MeiGen purchased credits; one poster, optional image references. |
| `generate_ai_background` | Both | MeiGen purchased credits; one product image with a white, smart or custom background. |
| `upscale_image` | Both | MeiGen purchased credits; faithful or creative enhancement from the original image. |
| `check_skill` | Both | Same MeiGen key; no additional generation charge. Returns completed images, failed modules and refund states. |
| `enhance_prompt` | Local only | Local prompt enhancement; no generation charge. |
| `manage_preferences` | Local only | Read/write local preferences; no generation charge. |
| `comfyui_workflow` | Local only | Manage local ComfyUI workflows; no MeiGen generation charge. |

Local synchronous image/video generation saves files by default; use download=false to skip, or wait=false to return a handle without downloading. Skills return preview/download links in both entries. Tools with the same name can have transport-specific input schemas; clients should read the connected server's tool list.

### Slash Commands

These commands require the Claude Code plugin; connecting a bare MCP server does not install them.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/meigen:gen <prompt>` | Quick generate — skip conversation, go straight to image |
| `/meigen:find <keywords>` | Search 1,446 curated prompts for inspiration |
| `/meigen:models` | Browse and switch AI models for this session |
| `/meigen:setup` | Interactive provider configuration wizard |

### Standalone CLI Mode

For shell scripts, CI pipelines, and terminal users who don't run an MCP host:

```bash
export MEIGEN_API_TOKEN=meigen_sk_...
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen --prompt "a calico cat in a sunlit kitchen"
npx -y meigen@2.0.2 gen -p "logo design" -m midjourney-v8.1 -r 1:1 --json
```

See [Use as CLI (no MCP host required)](#use-as-cli-no-mcp-host-required) for the full flag list.

### Smart Agents

The Claude Code plugin includes optional helpers for general image generation; direct tool calls remain supported. The five Skills handle their own planning and do not require these agents:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `image-generator` | Optional executor; preserves caller parameters and returns task handles/results |
| `prompt-crafter` | Writes multiple distinct prompts for batch generation (runs on Haiku for cost efficiency) |
| `gallery-researcher` | Deep gallery exploration without cluttering the main conversation (runs on Haiku) |

### Output Styles

Switch creative modes with `/output-style`:

- **Creative Director** — Art direction mode with visual storytelling, mood boards, and design thinking
- **Minimal** — Just images and file paths, no commentary. Ideal for batch workflows

### Automation Hooks

Automatic Preview is off by default. Set `MEIGEN_AUTO_OPEN=1` in the plugin host environment to open saved images on macOS; workflow callers otherwise control presentation. Async/no-download calls have no saved image to open.

- **Config Check** — Validates provider configuration on session start, guides setup if missing
- **Optional preview** — Set `MEIGEN_AUTO_OPEN=1` to open saved images in Preview (macOS)

<h2 id="providers">Providers</h2>

The **local npm server** supports three backends for `generate_image`. Configure one or multiple. The **remote server and all five Skills use MeiGen Cloud**; Skills do not accept a BYOK provider or run on ComfyUI.

### ComfyUI — Local & Free

Run generation on your own GPU with full control over models, samplers, and workflow parameters. Import any ComfyUI API-format workflow — MeiGen auto-detects KSampler, CLIPTextEncode, EmptyLatentImage, and LoadImage nodes.

```json
{
  "comfyuiUrl": "http://localhost:8188",
  "comfyuiDefaultWorkflow": "txt2img"
}
```

> Useful for models you run locally. Generation can stay on your machine when you use local files and a local workflow. The MeiGen Skills still use cloud services.

### MeiGen Cloud

Cloud API with multiple models: GPT Image 2.0, Nanobanana 2, Seedream 5.0, and more. No GPU required.

**Get your API key and credits:**

1. Sign in and open [API Keys](https://www.meigen.ai/profile/api-keys) in a desktop browser.
2. Create a key starting with `meigen_sk_` and save it in your MCP connection settings.
3. On the same account, open [Profile → Top Up](https://www.meigen.ai/profile) or [mobile Premium](https://www.meigen.ai/m/premium) to buy credits.

```json
{ "meigenApiToken": "meigen_sk_..." }
```

**General image resolution & quality** — `generate_image` accepts model-dependent options. Use `list_models` for the current default and supported values:

- `resolution`: e.g. `"1K"` / `"2K"` / `"4K"` — upgrade for posters, prints, wallpapers
- `quality`: e.g. `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"` — use `"low"` for quick drafts and thumbnails

**Seedance 2.0 video** now renders **native 4K — but only on the `pro` tier** (`mini`/`fast` cap at 480p/720p); pass `tier: "pro"` for 1080p/4K output.

Each model exposes its own supported resolutions and quality tiers — run `list_models` to see what's available. For up-to-date pricing across all models, see [meigen.ai/model-comparison](https://www.meigen.ai/model-comparison).

### Bring Your Own API (OpenAI-Compatible)

Connect **any** image generation API that follows the OpenAI format — Together AI, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, SiliconFlow, or your own endpoint. Just provide your key, base URL, and model name:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "sk-...",
  "openaiBaseUrl": "https://api.together.xyz/v1",
  "openaiModel": "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
}
```

> All three providers support **reference images**. MeiGen and OpenAI-compatible APIs accept URLs directly; ComfyUI accepts both URLs and local file paths, injecting them into LoadImage nodes in your workflow.

## Configuration

### Claude Code Plugin Setup

```
/meigen:setup
```

This command belongs to the Claude Code plugin. Other MCP hosts should use their own connection settings. For the five Skills, configure a MeiGen key; OpenAI-compatible credentials and ComfyUI only apply to general image generation. Store credentials in connection settings or the local config file, not a chat message.

### Config File

Configuration is stored at `~/.config/meigen/config.json`. ComfyUI workflows are stored at `~/.config/meigen/workflows/`.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables take priority over the config file.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN` | MeiGen API key; required for all five Skills and MeiGen generation |
| `MEIGEN_BASE_URL` | Local server API origin; default `https://www.meigen.ai`. Use an explicit local origin for backend development. |
| `MEIGEN_REQUEST_STORE_DIR` | Private local receipt directory (default `~/.meigen/requests`). Use an absolute path to an owned writable directory; POSIX permissions must be 0700, with no symlink. If storage is unavailable, generation uses process memory and returns `receiptWarning`; persist the returned request ID and exact inputs in your workflow for restart recovery. |
| `UPLOAD_GATEWAY_URL` | Local reference upload gateway; default `https://gen.meigen.ai`. Independent of `MEIGEN_BASE_URL`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your API key (any OpenAI-compatible provider) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | API base URL — change this to use Together AI, Fireworks AI, etc. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model ID supported by your endpoint |
| `COMFYUI_URL` | ComfyUI server URL (default: `http://localhost:8188`) |
| `MEIGEN_OUTPUT_DIR` | Override the local save directory for generated images (default: `~/Pictures/meigen`). Useful for sandboxed hosts (e.g. OpenClaw) where the default path is unreachable. |
| `MEIGEN_VIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR` | Override the local save directory for generated videos (default: `~/Movies/meigen`). |
| `XDG_PICTURES_DIR` | Linux only — when `MEIGEN_OUTPUT_DIR` is unset, images are saved to `$XDG_PICTURES_DIR/meigen` if this env var is set (e.g. by your desktop environment). Falls back to `~/Pictures/meigen`. |
| `XDG_VIDEOS_DIR` | Linux only — same logic as `XDG_PICTURES_DIR` but for videos. Falls back to `~/Movies/meigen`. |

## Privacy

MeiGen MCP respects your privacy. Here's what happens with your data:

- **ComfyUI (local)** — A local workflow with local files can run without cloud generation. Gallery queries and MeiGen Skills still use external services.
- **MeiGen Cloud and Skills** — Prompts and reference images are processed by MeiGen and its generation providers; result images are stored on Cloudflare R2. See [MeiGen Privacy Policy](https://www.meigen.ai/privacy-policy).
- **OpenAI-compatible** — Prompts and reference images are sent to the configured API endpoint. See your provider's privacy policy.
- **Reference image upload** — Local files use the configured upload gateway (default `gen.meigen.ai`) and Cloudflare R2. Local MCP ordinary generation and standard Skill references target 4096px / 8 MiB; the standalone `meigen gen` CLI retains its 2 MiB target. Upscale keeps original dimensions and uses the limits above. Skill preparation removes metadata and preserves transparency; GIF references use the first frame. Remote Skill uploads require a MeiGen key. Reference URLs are accessible to anyone with the link. Preserve accepted URLs for retries, keep your originals and download results you need; URLs are not promised as permanent archival storage. ComfyUI can use local paths without uploading.
- **Gallery search** — With a search query, the MeiGen API is queried (your query text is sent to `www.meigen.ai`); category browsing and offline fallback use bundled local data. **Prompt enhancement** runs locally with no external calls.

The local npm server adds no telemetry. Requests sent to MeiGen are subject to its service and privacy policies.

### Custom Storage Backend

If you prefer to use your own S3/R2 bucket for reference image uploads, set the `UPLOAD_GATEWAY_URL` environment variable or `uploadGatewayUrl` in `~/.config/meigen/config.json` to point to your own presign endpoint. The endpoint must implement:

```
POST /upload/presign
Content-Type: application/json

Request:  { "filename": "photo.jpg", "contentType": "image/jpeg", "size": 123456 }
Response: { "success": true, "presignedUrl": "https://...", "publicUrl": "https://..." }
```

The `presignedUrl` is used for a `PUT` upload, and `publicUrl` is the publicly accessible URL returned to the user. This option applies to local uploads. For standard Skills, the local server automatically prepares a custom CDN URL through authenticated `/api/skills/upload` before submission. Upscale passes a public original URL to the backend for source validation and preparation. Custom gateway images must remain publicly reachable without authentication or redirects.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Next step |
|---|---|
| New Skills do not appear | Remote: refresh/reconnect the tool list after the backend is deployed. Local: confirm the connection runs `meigen@2.0.2`, then restart. Installing npm alone does not deploy the APIs. |
| Invalid or missing key | Create/check the key in [desktop API Keys](https://www.meigen.ai/profile/api-keys) and update the MCP connection's header or `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN`. Restart a local server after changing its environment. Do not paste the key into chat. |
| Insufficient credits, but the website shows a balance | API calls use **purchased credits only**, never daily free credits. Use [Profile → Top Up](https://www.meigen.ai/profile) on the same account; then ask the assistant to continue. A rejected call should not be polled. |
| The image cannot be uploaded | Use a real local file (local npm) or a public direct HTTPS image link. Check format/size and remove login or redirect requirements. If the host cannot read attachments, use a direct link. Upload failure has not started a generation. |
| A tool timed out or the host restarted | Recover Skills with `check_skill`, and ordinary image/video jobs with `check_generation`; do not automatically submit a new paid request. A host with a 60-second tool timeout may need a longer timeout, such as 240 seconds for Skill submission. |
| Some product-detail modules failed | Keep and display completed images; show the failed modules and their reported refund state. Do not regenerate the whole batch or add paid replacements automatically. |
| The request is rate-limited | Follow the returned waiting instruction. A daily request limit is separate from the credit balance; repeated polling or topping up does not reset it. |
| I configured OpenAI or ComfyUI, but a Skill still asks for a MeiGen key | Those backends support local general image generation. The five Skills use MeiGen Cloud and purchased credits. |

For Skill client implementers: generate `requestId` internally, keep it with the original inputs, and query `check_skill` after interruptions. Follow `nextAction`; processing responses normally suggest a 10-second polling interval. Reuse returned `retryParameters` exactly, including uploaded URLs. A new ID represents a new paid attempt; changing inputs under an existing ID is rejected. These IDs belong in the client, not in questions to the user.

<a id="upgrading"></a>

## Upgrading from 1.4.0

- **Remote MCP:** keep the endpoint and your valid MeiGen key. After backend deployment, reconnect and call `list_skills`; expect five Skills and 14 tools. Updating npm alone does not deploy the APIs.
- **Local npm:** change pinned configurations to `meigen@2.0.2` and restart; global installations can run `npm install -g meigen@2.0.2`. Expect 17 tools. Check that the version is available on npm first.
- **Plugin users:** update the Claude marketplace plugin, OpenClaw native plugin or standalone ClawHub Skill separately. Updating npm alone does not replace installed instruction files. Do not add a second MCP entry when the plugin already supplies one.
- **Composable calls:** local `wait: true` / `download: true` remain defaults. New workflows should persist UUID `requestId`, use `wait: false` and recover by that ID. Remote legacy `attemptId` remains accepted; older receipts cannot retroactively prove every historical parameter mismatch. Update plugin instructions as well as the server to get the optional creative flow.
- **Existing configuration and jobs:** general generation keeps its MeiGen/OpenAI/ComfyUI configuration; the five Skills need a MeiGen key and purchased credits. Preserve IDs and inputs for interrupted jobs and recover them; an upgrade is not a reason to resubmit a paid request.
- **Input changes:** local Skill paths must be absolute, `~/` or `file://`; relative paths are rejected instead of being resolved against a hidden process directory. Images lose metadata, GIF references use the first frame, and Upscale needs a still original. Keep original assets and download results you need; result links are not a permanent-storage guarantee.

## Releasing

The npm package version **2.0.2** is separate from the MCP protocol date and SDK version.

Maintainers: follow [RELEASING.md](https://github.com/jau123/MeiGen-AI-Design-MCP/blob/main/RELEASING.md) for the 2.0.2 build, package checks and publishing process. Store `NPM_TOKEN` only in this repository's ignored `.env.local` as described there. It authorizes npm publishing and is separate from the `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN` used by customers. Never include either credential in commits or the published package.
